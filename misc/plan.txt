---------------------------------
Reflections on Purists
---------------------------------
There are a few problems with the reformers in their current state, most of it is related to the NCR.
The Purists were in a great position for interesting gameplay, bordering on the NCR meant that they would be building up for an inevitable conflict.
After the defeat of the NCR, the Purist campaign is basically over and they are free to conquer the rest of the world. 

Path for Purists:
Stage 1: Expansion East
Stage 2: Preparation for NCR
Stage 3: War with NCR
Stage 4: Map painting

---------------------------------
Purists vs Reformers
---------------------------------
The internal conflict was represented somewhat minimalistically in the Purist path. The Purists will not go down as easily as the Reformers, however.
There are already several focuses that represent this internal struggle, mostly in the form of purges that remove the positive Enclave modifiers.
This internal struggle should always be on the mind of the player. They should be keeping a careful eye on the party popularity.

Decisions:
- Multiple decisions in their own category related to consolidating power
- Crisis when the Purists outnumber the Reformers
	- repeating crisis that costs stability, war support-
	- increases severity of political infighting idea?
	- distraction decisions (training exercise)

Events:
- More events that can shift the political landscape
	- conflicts within scientists		(DONE)
	- conflicts within officers			(DONE)
	- assassination attempt on Douglas 	(DONE)
	- Desertions
	- Internal sabotage					(DONE)
	- Vandalism
	- Speech by Anderson				(DONE)
	- fist fight in cafetaria			(DONE)
	- vertibird crash
	
Modifiers:
- Modify the political infighting idea to be better/worse?

Focuses:
- Reformer support minimums for the purges?

---------------------------------
On the NCR:
---------------------------------
The Reformers should be capable of diplomacy with the NCR, if nothing else to stop the need to hide activities from the NCR.

It would be interesting to lock diplomacy with the NCR behind a minimum amount of (cored?) states. Being strong enough would make the NCR think twice about invading you.
This would make the early game a little similar to the Purists: a race against the clock to expand eastwards and build up power relative to the NCR.
The goal is different, since the Reformers simply want to make themselves unappealing to invade. They will not enjoy the same buffs and debuffs as the Purists that made their attack on the NCR possible.
As a result, a war against the NCR at this stage of the game should not be possible to win.
The threat of Caeser's legion may also help in making the NCR somewhat more open to the idea of diplomacy with their old enemies.
Diplomacy with the NCR could be a mini game involving taking decisions to improve relations and events.
The player may also prefer to ally themselves with another nation, in that case, the NCR may be prevented from attacking by the fact that they would be pulled into a way with that alternative ally (usually CES)

General path for the Reformers:
Stage 1: Dealing with internal conflicts 				( Hide activities <-> Increase party popularity <-> Military expansion <-> development )
Stage 2: Expanding East
Stage 3: Diplomacy with the NCR
Stage 4: Diplomacy & development & Subterfuge
Stage 5: Big war with NCR or Caesar legion
Stage 6: Settle down as State of Nevada or declare yourself the United States

The advantage that the Reformers do have is their greater capacity for subterfuge.
This will most likely be incredibly valuable when dealing with the NCR on your own.
One problem here is that the base game will be balanced around a rather equal conflict between the NCR and Caeser's legion.
The player choosing sides in this conflict may shift the balance in such a way that it's always easy for the player if they wait for the right moment to strike.
Ideas for fixing this issue:
	- secret buffs to the enemy country that you have allied against
	- immediate conflict with the victorious ally (player allies with CES and takes out the NCR, only to have to fight CES immediately afterwards)
	

---------------------------------
On Map painting:
---------------------------------
The Reformers, if they go full USA, are essentially map painters. To prevent this from getting boring, several mechanics should make expansion challenging in the late game.
Ideas for this are:
	- negative events and modifiers representing overextension
	- addition of peace time mechanics
	- anti Enclave alliances forming by event
	- claims on enemy territories made more difficult?
	- A special coring mechanic that will be costly
	- Alternative, civilian used for military factories and manpower
	- declaration of independence and revolts
	- tribal and raider regions continue to be troublesome after conquest
	
---------------------------------
Enclave Technology
---------------------------------
The Enclave starts with late game technology. This was no problem for the Purists, since they have a critical lack of manpower to compensate for. 
The Reformers, on the other hand, will not have the same limitations. So it seems like they should be kicked back to a lower level of technology until later in the game.
Sabotage by Purist loyalists could explain that from a lore perspective, though I will have to see if I can mechanically lock them from certain technologies until later in the game.
I'm sure the brotherhood of Steel does not simply start with the ability to research top-level power armor, so whatever limiting mechanic they use could come in handy here.
	
---------------------------------
Internal politics
---------------------------------
I always thought politics and political parties were an underused element of the game. After theorizing on how to use it more, I do understand the difficulties in doing so.
Initially, I was hoping to create 3-4 political parties within the Reformers that would become the main parties after they consolidate their power. That said, mechanics that involve multiple possible parties may prove to be very challenging.
It might be wise to cut this idea for now and see if it's possible to bring it back once more of the tree is done.

---------------------------------
Coring
---------------------------------
Purists could not core, this was a simple rule with the intention of severely limiting their manpower. Perhaps the biggest difference between the two factions is ability to core.
Yet, I want to make coring a little more interesting for the Reformers. They will have to develop provinces to increase their legitimacy in the eyes of the populace.

Currently, the idea is to let them connect provinces to the power grid. Permanently reducing electricity in one province of theirs (engine limitation prevents dynamic resource allocation).
Only provinces connected to cores can be connected to the power grid. 
Once they have been connected to the power grid, a police force can be deployed to a province. This would cost infantry equipment and/or manpower.
When all of the above is completed, the province can be cored.
This process may take an amount of time, during which events could pop up that can aid or hamper coring, representing the inevitable conflicts resulting from incorporating an area.
I was also considering adding additional difficulties or costs when attempting to core provinces that previously belonged to Raider or Tribal factions, representing the cultural differences that would make civilizing them difficult.

---------------------------------
A Nation Reborn
---------------------------------
The big payoff of the Reformer path is that juicy flag, name and color change. Because of this, it should not come to early in the campaign.
Ideally, the Enclave would declare themselves the United States only in a situation where they have or are about to attack the NCR.
It seems unlikely that the USA would allow any other state to occupy it's claimed territories, so war with the NCR seems inevitable.

Another option is to take a more moderate path and declare yourself the State of Nevada. This would give you a claim to a large area of land while being compatible with the NCR.
This could lead to a situation where the United States is a military alliances between several autonomous states instead of a centralized power. 
This would be a satisfying ending for people who want more diplomacy, since the United States is also restored in a sense that is closer to the original post-revolutionary vision of the USA.

---------------------------------
The Old World Party (NCR)
---------------------------------
In OWB, the NCR has an Enclave political party. 

---------------------------------
National focus tree
---------------------------------
The current national focus tree is largely unfinished.
It exists of a few small stray trees, one big tree and several neat trees to the right.

1. Internal conflict tree 	(aka purges)
2. Infiltrate NCR tree 		(reduce suspicion)
3. Nation Reborn tree 		(main tree)
4. Enclave Radio tree
5. Expansion tree
6. USSS tree
7. Diplomacy tree
8. Department of Defense tree

Stage 1: Dealing with internal conflicts

In this stage, the player will be tasked with balancing dealing with the Purists and hiding from the NCR.
Political power will be very short and needs to be carefully managed. Failing to hide from the NCR 3 times will lead to a game over state (NCR declares war).
The decisions that involve outright purges should feel significant and impactful.
It may also be interesting to lock certain repression decisions behind 1 or 2 levels of "expanded government powers", either a national focus or another decision.
Currently, a crisis event happens when the Purists outnumber the Reformer. There are no severe consequences for this for the moment, so that should be revisited.
It may be good to add a few emergency decisions available only when this crisis is in progress. They should help solve the crisis in emergencies but come at great cost to manpower/stability/war support/pp/ncr suspicion

Another interesting way to spend PP on this matter could be hiring advisors that are loyalist above all else. 
Some of these advisors may provide penalties to their respective areas in return for a boost to party popularity. They themselves being essentially incompetent bootlickers.

The player should have access to at least the expansion into New Reno to keep them interested in the map. 
Further expansion may be locked depending on if we want to draw a clear line between phases.

TREES:
1. Internal conflict tree 	(aka purges)
2. Infiltrate NCR tree 		(reduce suspicion)
3. Take New Reno tree 		(start of main tree)

TODO:
	- Add loyalist advisors, people (50%)
	- adjust set examples decision (100%)
	- More events to influence PP, NCR detection, politics
	- More decisions to influence PP, NCR detection, politics (30%)
	- Add decision to arm raiders (100%)
	- Game over state for Purists take over
		- coup?
		- war with NCR?
		- civil war?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		
Stage 2: Expanding East

At this tage, the player will either be stable or still stablizing. Depending on whether we go for the strict seperation approach with stage 1.
After having cored New Reno, they are provided with new Manpower and National Focus trees. The Enclave Radio tree will provide them with bonus ideas.
The details of these ideas are not decided on yet. There is also the possibility of disabling this tree until after the NCR has been pacified, since openly blasting Enclave music seems like a bad idea when tryng to lay low.
Since the player ahs been expanding in this stage, this might be the opportune moment to introduce the coring mechanics of the mod.

TODO:
	- finish expansion tree
	- Basic Coring mechanic
		- Energy button
		- Police button
	
Stage 3: Diplomacy with the NCR
This stage starts when the player has achieved enough size to 

TODO:
	- basic NCR mechanic
	
Stage 4: Diplomacy & development & Subterfuge
	- finish diplomacy and espionage tree
	- finish Nation Reborn Tree
	
Stage 5: Big war with NCR or Caesar legion

Stage 6: Settle down as State of Nevada or declare yourself the United States
